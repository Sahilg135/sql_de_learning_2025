An important thing to remember: aggregators only aggregate vertically. If you want to perform a calculation across

-- ========================================   
/*
MIN and MAX are SQL aggregation functions that return the lowest and highest values in a particular column.

They're similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns. 

Depending on the column type, 
MIN will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as close alphabetically to "A" as possible. 
As you might suspect, MAX does the opposite—it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical 
value closest alphabetically to "Z."

3. In any row for which the conditional statement is false, nothing happens in that row, leaving a null value in the is_a_senior column.
